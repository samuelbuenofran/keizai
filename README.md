# Keizai - Economics and Geopolitical Stability Analysis Tool

Welcome to the official GitHub repository of the SEGSAT tool developed by the fictious company Keizai. This tool was developed as part of the "Software Engineering Laboratory" subject of the Analysis and Systems Development course at the Indaiatuba Technology College (FATEC Indaiatuba).

This tool was developed by Samuel Bueno Francisco.

The main aim of this software is to help investors to make better decisions when investing in a country. The tool will provide information about the country's economic and geopolitical stability, as well as the country's main economic sectors.

## What does "Keizai" mean?

"Keizai" is the Japanese word for "economics", and I know what you are probably wondering, "Why did you choose a Japanese word for an English tool?". Well, the answer is simple, I like Japanese culture and I wanted to use a Japanese word for the name of the company. Besides, Brazil is home to the largest Japanese community outside of Japan, so I think it's a good fit.

## How to use the tool

This is a tool that is supposed to be hosted somewhere on the web, so you can access it from anywhere. However, everyone knows that hosting a website requires high-end equipment capable of handling a lot of traffic, and that costs money. So, for the purpose of this project, I will be using a free hosting service called [000webhost](https://www.000webhost.com/). This service is free, but it has some limitations, such as a 1GB storage limit and a 10GB bandwidth limit. This means that I can't host a lot of files, and I can't have a lot of people accessing the website at the same time. But, since this is just a college project, I think it will be enough.

Additionally, you need to create a login and a password, so the "login" section in the landing page can take you to your own dashboard. Having a single dashboard would create problems for the users trying to use the tool. For example, if two users are trying to use the tool at the same time, they would be able to see each other's data, which is not good. So, the best solution is to create a login system, so each user can have their own dashboard.
